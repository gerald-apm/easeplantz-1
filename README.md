## Overview
easeplantz is a plant diseases detection application developed using the Kotlin language. This application utilizes machine learning built using tensorflow and keras. Easeplantz has two main key features, which are:

- **Plant disease diagnosis**. User took picture of the leaf or pick the picture from gallery and easeplantz will give the diagnosis
- **Recommendations**. After getting the diagnosis, application will also tell the user about what is the right way to treat the disease

## How to Use
1. The user selects the type of plant, from potato, corn, and tomato,  that will be detected by the disease through the leaves
2. The user enter pictures of leaves through albums or can take photos of leaves directly using the application's camera
3. The image is sent to the server and will return the prediction results along with recommendations for handling the disease
